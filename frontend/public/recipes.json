Next add the olive oil to the mixture.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith your hands and a spatula to scrape down the bowl, mix everything together to form the dough. Punch down and knead the dough, turning it as you go, for at least 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, soft and pliable. Add a bit of flour to the dough as needed. Form the dough into a round ball.\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd some olive oil to your hands and smooth it over the dough ball to coat it and leave it in the bowl.
